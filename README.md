# unity-mass-downloader
This script downloads every current version of Unity available through their API

To use this file, just change the dest_folder in the downloadUnity.py script and run "python downloadUnity.py". It will take a long time!!

This is using Python 2.7. Yes, I know. I'm sorry. I have my reasons that are out of my control.
